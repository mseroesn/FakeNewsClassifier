<h1>Text Classification using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers</h1>

This project demonstrates text classification using three different classifiers: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The dataset used in this project is a collection of news articles labeled as "real" or "fake".

<h2>Dataset</h2>

The dataset used in this project is available in the DataSet.csv file, which contains two columns: "title" and "label". The "title" column contains the text content of the article, and the "label" column specifies whether the article is real or fake.

<h2>Setup</h2>

To run this project, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies: pandas, nltk, scikit-learn
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd text-classification
Run the script: python text_classification.py

<h2>Results</h2>

The project outputs the classification report for each of the three classifiers: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The classification report contains the precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics for each label (real and fake). The results can be used to compare the performance of each classifier and choose the best one for the given task.
